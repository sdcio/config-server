# Release 0.0.53

[ChangeLog](https://github.com/sdcio/config-server/releases)

## deviation rework

reworked deviations:
- dedicated deviation CR
- removed the unamanged config CR -> this is a device deviation CR now
- support both revertive and non revertive mode of oepration -> a global flag defines the behavior and you can overwrite it per CR

behavior in non revertive mode
- Accept deviation: default
- Deny the full deviation: -> delete deviation-CR. (config-server reapply the config-CR w/o the related deviation CR)
- Deny a piece of the deviation -> delete that part of the deviation-CR (config-server reapply the config CR w the updated deviation CR)
