# Release 0.0.46

[ChangeLog](https://github.com/sdcio/config-server/releases)

## better output for k get sdc

resource from the aggregated api server were not prefixed with the kind/group and this was different from how crd resources were presented. In this release we align them such that a user does not see a difference in the table representation.

## add priority of a config resource table output

in the table output we now include the priority

## added network policy

most cluster dont allow network traffic between namespaces, added a network policy to our artifacts
